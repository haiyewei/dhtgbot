# dhtgbot-rs

[中文](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/blob/master/README.md)

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot) | [Releases](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/releases) | [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/haiyewei/dhtgbot) | [GHCR](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/pkgs/container/dhtgbot)

`dhtgbot-rs` is a pure Rust Telegram bot project that coordinates multiple bots and external services for the following tasks:

- `master`: administration, backup, restore, debugging
- `tdl`: watches messages and forwards supported links to `tdlr`
- `xdl`: queries X/Twitter content, monitors likes, tracks authors, downloads media, and uploads through `tdlr`

The project itself is a single binary called `dhtgbot`, but it depends on three external tools at runtime:

- `amagi`: Twitter/X bridge service
- `tdlr`: Telegram upload and forward service
- `aria2`: download engine

## Features

- Pure Rust rewrite
- Configuration-driven, no hardcoded local absolute paths
- Unified global serial task queue
- SQLite storage with the legacy `key/value + {"value": ...}` model restored
- Database backup and restore via `master`
- External services launched from configurable commands
- Release packages ship with installer scripts

```

## Installation

### Windows

The release package includes:

- `scripts/install.ps1`

It will:

1. Download and install `amagi`
2. Download and install `tdlr`
3. Download and install `aria2` 1.37.0
4. Download or install `dhtgbot`
5. Create the app home, example config, launcher entry, and add commands to the user `PATH`

If `amagi`, `tdlr`, or `aria2c` already exists in the environment, the script downloads the package first and then asks whether it should overwrite the existing installation. The default answer is no.

Example:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1
```

Remote execution:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/master/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

If you need options for remote execution, use environment variables:

```powershell
$env:DHTGBOT_INSTALL_VERSION = "v0.2.1"
$env:DHTGBOT_INSTALL_SKIP_DEPENDENCIES = "1"
$env:DHTGBOT_INSTALL_PROXY = "1"
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/master/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Linux / macOS

The release package includes:

- `scripts/install.sh`
- `scripts/install-systemd.sh` (Linux only)

Regular install:

```bash
bash ./scripts/install.sh
```

Remote execution:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Install as a `systemd` service on Linux:

```bash
bash ./scripts/install-systemd.sh
```

Remote execution:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/master/scripts/install-systemd.sh | bash
```

`install.sh` will:

1. Download and install `amagi`
2. Download and install `tdlr`
3. Download the `aria2` 1.37.0 source archive and install it into the user environment
4. Extract the `dhtgbot` release package into `./dhtgbot` under the current directory
5. Keep `./dhtgbot/config.example.yaml` as the reference file
6. Prompt you to copy it to `./dhtgbot/config.yaml` and continue the remaining configuration work

Notes:

- On Linux and macOS, `aria2` currently uses source installation, so a basic build toolchain is required
- Existing `amagi`, `tdlr`, or `aria2c` installations are not overwritten automatically
- After remote extraction, the original archive is deleted, so the project directory is not left with `*.tar.gz`
- `install.sh` does not install `dhtgbot` itself into `PATH` by default
- after `install.sh` finishes successfully, it opens an interactive shell inside the project directory; exiting that shell returns to the previous location
- if you need the old runtime-style behavior, use `bash ./scripts/install.sh --layout runtime`
- `install-systemd.sh` first checks whether it is running from a `scripts/` directory inside an existing project/workspace
- when it is executed locally from an existing workspace, it reuses `../` as the `systemd` working directory and creates the background service from that local `dhtgbot` binary
- when it is executed remotely, or when no existing workspace is detected, it falls back to the runtime-layout install and places the main program in the service user's app directory

### Overwrite policy

The installer supports:

```text
DHTGBOT_INSTALL_OVERWRITE=prompt   # default
DHTGBOT_INSTALL_OVERWRITE=always
DHTGBOT_INSTALL_OVERWRITE=never
```

### Remote binary source selection

Installer scripts download binaries from the matching workflow output based on version selection:

- default: `latest`
  downloads the latest stable GitHub Release: <https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/releases/latest>
- `DHTGBOT_INSTALL_VERSION=daily`
  downloads assets published by the `Daily Build` workflow under the `daily` tag: <https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/releases/tag/daily>
- `DHTGBOT_INSTALL_VERSION=v0.2.1`
  downloads assets from a specific tagged Release, for example: <https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/releases/tag/v0.2.1>

Dependencies follow the same pattern:

- `amagi` comes from the `amagi-rs` GitHub Release: <https://github.com/bandange/amagi-rs/releases>
- `tdlr` comes from the `tdlr` GitHub Release: <https://github.com/haiyewei/tdlr/releases>
- `aria2` comes from the official `release-1.37.0` GitHub Release: <https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases/tag/release-1.37.0>

## Docker

The repository now ships a complete container setup. The image includes:

- `dhtgbot`
- musl Linux `amagi`
- musl Linux `tdlr`
- `aria2`

The container base image is Alpine, and the Rust binary chain is aligned on `musl`:

- `dhtgbot`: downloaded from the GitHub Release asset `dhtgbot-*-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
- `amagi`: downloaded from `*-unknown-linux-musl` release assets
- `tdlr`: downloaded from `*-unknown-linux-musl` release assets
- `aria2`: installed from Alpine packages

At runtime the container uses `/var/lib/dhtgbot` as its working directory, and the program ultimately reads `/var/lib/dhtgbot/config.yaml`. The entrypoint switches into that directory before starting `dhtgbot`.

Recommended initialization flow:

```bash
docker pull docker.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:latest
docker compose run --rm dhtgbot init
```

That `init` step will:

- create `./.docker-data/config.yaml`
- reuse the file if it already exists without overwriting it
- print the runtime directory, config path, and next-step hints

Then edit this file on the host:

```bash
./.docker-data/config.yaml
```

At minimum, replace these placeholder values first:

- `bots.master.token`
- `bots.tdl.token` / `bots.xdl.token` when those bots are enabled
- `bots.tdl.forward.account` / `bots.xdl.account`
- `bots.xdl.twitter.cookies` when X/Twitter features are enabled

Start the service only after the config is ready:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Local image builds follow the same flow:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

You can also use GHCR directly:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:latest
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/.docker-data:/var/lib/dhtgbot" ghcr.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:latest help
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/.docker-data:/var/lib/dhtgbot" ghcr.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:latest init
```

The container also provides these helper commands:

- `help`: show container startup help
- `init`: initialize the runtime directory and create `config.yaml`
- `config-path`: print the in-container config path
- `show-config`: print the current runtime `config.yaml`
- `example-config`: print the bundled Docker config template

Notes:

- [compose.yaml](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/blob/master/compose.yaml) stores runtime data in `./.docker-data`
- after `docker compose run --rm dhtgbot init`, edit `./.docker-data/config.yaml` directly on the host
- if `config.yaml` still contains template placeholders, the entrypoint prints setup guidance and refuses to start the main program
- the container exposes `4567`, `8787`, and `6800`
- the Docker-specific config template switches `amagi`, `tdlr`, and `aria2` to container-friendly listen flags
- `dhtgbot` still talks to those services through `127.0.0.1`, so the internal behavior matches the local process model
- the Docker setup no longer depends on Debian / glibc
- the `Docker Publish` workflow syncs the repository `README.md` to the Docker Hub Overview: <https://hub.docker.com/r/haiyewei/dhtgbot>

## Configuration

After installation, the runtime directory includes:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\dhtgbot\app\config.example.yaml`
- Linux/macOS: `~/.local/share/dhtgbot/config.example.yaml`

Copy [config.example.yaml](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/blob/master/config.example.yaml) to `config.yaml` before editing it.

Important fields:

- `bots.master.base.token`
- `bots.master.admins`
- `bots.tdl.base.token`
- `bots.xdl.base.token`
- `bots.xdl.twitter.cookies`
- `services.amagi.base_url`
- `services.amagi.start_command`
- `services.tdlr.base_url`
- `services.tdlr.start_command`
- `services.aria2.rpc_url`
- `services.aria2.start_command`

Notes:

- It is recommended to wrap `bots.xdl.twitter.cookies` in single quotes
- `bots.xdl.twitter.cookies` is forwarded to `amagi` on each request through the `X-Amagi-Twitter-Cookie` header, so it does not rely on a cookie bound at `amagi` startup
- `bots.tdl.forward.account` and `bots.xdl.account` should be the numeric `user_id` of a `tdlr` account because `account` is now sent through the structured HTTP API
- `dhtgbot` now talks to `tdlr service --http-bind ...` through `GET /v1/version`, `POST /v1/forwards`, and `POST /v1/uploads`, not the legacy `/execute` cliapi
- `start_command` should use environment commands, not hardcoded absolute paths
- The program always reads `config.yaml` from the current working directory
- The generated launcher switches into the app home automatically

## Bots

### master

Main commands:

- `/help`
- `/backup`
- `/backup_status`
- `/restore`
- `/restore_cancel`
- `/restore_nozip`
- `/echo`
- `/mdata`

The restore flow is:

- upload ZIP
- provide ZIP password, or use `/restore_nozip`
- provide import password
- read `.sql` from the ZIP
- replace the SQLite database with the imported dump

### tdl

Watches configured chats/topics and forwards supported links to `tdlr`.

Main commands:

- `/help`
- `/version`
- `/forward`

### xdl

Provides X/Twitter related features.

Main commands:

- `/profile`
- `/tweet`
- `/tweets`
- `/search`
- `/tweetdl`
- `/tweet_like_dl`
- `/author_track`

Supported workflows:

- single tweet lookup
- media download
- likes polling
- author tracking
- media upload through `tdlr`

## Data model

The storage layer has been restored to the legacy schema:

- table shape: `bot_xxx(key, value)`
- value shape: `{"value": ...}`

Missing tables are created automatically at startup, and known old/intermediate row formats are normalized on boot.

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo test --locked --workspace
cargo run
```

Startup sequence:

1. read `config.yaml`
2. initialize SQLite
3. start or connect to `amagi`, `tdlr`, and `aria2`
4. run enabled bots

## Release

The repository contains three workflows:

- [Cargo CI](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/actions/workflows/cargo.yml)
- [Daily Build](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/actions/workflows/daily.yml)
- [Release](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/actions/workflows/release.yml)
- [Docker Publish](https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

Release packages contain:

- `dhtgbot`
- `config.example.yaml`
- installer scripts
- Linux `systemd` installer

The installer flow supports both:

- local execution from a downloaded release package
- remote execution from GitHub Raw
- remote binary download from workflow-published assets

Docker images are published to:

- `docker.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:latest`
- `docker.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:vX.Y.Z`
- `docker.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:sha-<commit>`
- `ghcr.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:latest`
- `ghcr.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:vX.Y.Z`
- `ghcr.io/haiyewei/dhtgbot:sha-<commit>`

Registry pages:

- Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/haiyewei/dhtgbot>
- GHCR: <https://github.com/haiyewei/dhtgbot/pkgs/container/dhtgbot>

The `Docker Publish` workflow requires these GitHub Secrets:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` should be a Docker Hub access token, not your account password.

GHCR does not require an extra custom secret. The workflow uses the built-in:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`

The workflow must keep `packages: write` permission enabled.

## Status

This is an operational repository, not a generic SDK. The main focus is:

- behavior parity
- explicit configuration
- fixed runtime directory
- complete installation flow
- easier future extension for additional bots
